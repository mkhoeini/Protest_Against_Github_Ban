# Protest_Against_Github_Ban
Star and fork this repo and let's have a voice against the ridiculous GitHub ban against countries that are part of the USA sanctions.


Hi,

I am an Iranian developer living in Sweden. Lately I experience a ban and restriction on my GitHub account just because I used to live in iran and so did all my programmer and developer friends back in Iran.

This is clearly against the concept of the open source community and I geniunly believe this beautiful concept can't and should not be a part of politics. Open source idea is simple, contribute to a project for free and make software free and accessible to everyone around the world. But this restrictions certainly violate the very basics of this beautiful concept.

Let's star and fork this repo so we have a voice, let's get this on all social media and email all the people that have a voice in free and open source software. Let's prevent such beautiful concept turn to a part of the politics.

We the developers and programmers, believe in freedom and software freedom, we with all respect want to have this access back and together make contribution and continue to create something free, beautiful and accessible to everyone around the world.

We are developer and programmers, we have nothing to do with world policts and neither of us chose where to be born, we want to have access to this service like everyone else around the world.
